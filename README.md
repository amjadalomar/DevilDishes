# We are the devils of software...
## Project Description:
We created a CRUD app in which handles recipes. Users can create new recipes, view recipes, edit recipes, and delete recipes. There is also an explore feature that allows users to look through a repository of recipes and add them to their saved recipes. Users can also search for recipes or filter by tags or their favorited recipes. While looking at a recipe, users can check off completed steps, use the in-app timer, and get a celebratory message when they finish cooking the dish!
